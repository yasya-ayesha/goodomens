        Beelzebub is a character in Amazon series Good Omens and the leader of the forces of Hell and the archangel Gabriel's equivalent. Beelzebub is known as the "Lord of the Flies." In Good Omens, flies are often seen buzzing about their face.

    <h2>personality</h2>
    <p>
        Beelzebub is seen to be rather cold and calm, and is always frowning. The only time in which Beelzebub is seen smiling is when they are trying to appeal to Adam to start the war, telling him that once the war is concluded, he will get to rule the world. Beelzebub is rather serious about the war between Heaven and Hell, becoming rather frustrated when Adam won't start the war and end the world.
