        Adam Young is one of the main characters in Amazon series Good Omens. He is the leader of the Them, dog-owner, and kid. He finds himself at the centre of events at the Apocalypse and draws the attention of all sides as creation hurtles towards its final battle. Adam is the true Antichrist and son of Satan who was misplaced at birth thanks to a mix-up by the demon Crowley and the Chattering Nuns of St Beryls and instead of being raised by the American Dowling Family was given to the Young Family and raised in Tadfield. Adam was given a Hellhound to rule by his side. He did not want a big dog, so the Hellhound made itself a smaller dog and ran down into the Them's play ditch. Adam named the Hellhound "Dog" because it was a simple name.
    <h2>personality</h2>
    <p>
        Adam is, in Aziraphale's words, 'human incarnate'. He is a friendly young boy. He is somewhat confident and a bit bossy as the leader of the Them, but is also shown to be very caring to his friends and other people he meets such as Anathema. He is shown to be a bit naive, as he believes everything he reads in the magazines that Anathema gives him and initially believes that Armageddon is the only way to undo all the damage that has been done to the Earth and make things right. However, this can be attributed to his age.<br>Adam is also quite brave, as are his friends, as he unwaveringly refuses to kick-start the End of the World even when Gabriel and Beelzebub are trying to push him to do it. He also unflinchingly disinherits his biological father, Satan, who he says was 'never there'. Adam's caring nature extends to his unknowingly using his powers to do good, such as restoring the rain forests, getting rid of a nuclear reactor (although power is still produced), and summoning the Kraken so that it would target whaling ships and protect whales. Adam has a vivid imagination that he uses to come up with the best games, which is why he is the leader of the Them.
