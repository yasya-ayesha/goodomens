        Good Omens is a comedic novel by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman. The plot focuses primarily on the attempts of Heaven and Hell to bring about the Apocalypse and the efforts of two characters—an angel named Aziraphale and a demon named Crowley—to thwart such attempts. Aziraphale and Crowley have both lived among humans for several thousand years and have grown fond of humanity and their lives on Earth. Therefore, despite representing opposing divine parties, the two know each other well and interact often—to Crowley, Aziraphale is “an enemy for six thousand years now, which made him sort of a friend".

    <h2>about book</h2>
    <p>
        The book is a comedy about the birth of the son of Satan and the coming of the End Times. There are attempts by the angel Aziraphale and the demon Crowley to sabotage the coming of the end times, having grown accustomed to their comfortable surroundings in England. One subplot features a mixup at the small country hospital on the day of birth and the growth of the Antichrist, Adam, who grows up with the wrong family, in the wrong country village. Another subplot concerns the summoning of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, each a big personality in their own right. In 2003, the novel was listed at number 68 on the BBC's survey The Big Read.
