        Crowley is one of the main characters in Amazon series Good Omens. Being the snake that tempted Eve in the Garden of Eden, naturally, his human form also has snake eyes, which he usually covers with designer sunglasses. He is Aziraphale's best friend. Crowley has a flat in Mayfair, London, which he does not consider a home, but simply a place he returns to when he's in town and is only filled with a Stereo System without speakers, an alphabetically arranged collection of what he refers to as Soul music, a copy of "The Extremely Big Book Of Astronomy", a table, a huge throne, a statue of an angel and a demon "fighting", a flat screen TV, an original sketch of Da Vinci's painting "Mona Lisa", which hides a safe containing gloves, tongs and a bottle of holy water, which was given to him by Aziraphale and, last but definitely not least, the only thing he devotes any real attention to: a room filled with London's most luxurious, verdant and beautiful, but also most terrified plants.

    <h2>personality</h2>
    <p>
        Crowley is overall a non-threatening demon. He somewhat attempts to be evil in his own way, but is actually quite morally decent in human terms. He objects to the killing of innocent people and animals and wants to save the world, albeit for his own reasons. He has a flair for the dramatic and can be a heavy drinker. He seems to not take his job seriously and doesn't really partake in "normal demon" things. Most of his "accomplishments" were faked or done by humans, which he considers better at making their own lives miserable than he is. He thinks of himself as evil, but is usually a minor inconvenience at worst. He also has a soft spot for Aziraphale, thinking of him as his best friend and more and typically going out of his way to save or help him. Crowley rarely thinks things through, as many of his own plans end up backfiring on him. He is sarcastic but overall rather friendly and lovable, especially compared to other demons.  Crowley is also curious by nature, and his tendency to ask too many questions caused him to Fall. Unlike other demons, Crowley has an imagination - something that helps him in various situations, such as keeping himself and the Bentley together while driving through the burning M25 to reach Tadfield airbase.
