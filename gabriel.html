        Gabriel is one of the main characters in Amazon series Good Omens. He is Aziraphale's boss. It is Gabriel's job to make sure that Armageddon starts on time. He's handsome, a snappy dresser â€” and utterly certain that he's right ... about everything.

    <h2>personality</h2>
    <p>
        Gabriel is usually quite calm and well mannered to his coworkers, however his true colours are present when under stress or when not receiving utter compliance from his underlings. Gabriel is rude, self-righteous and very judgmental, also impatient and quick to anger as seen in the execution scene of "The Very Last Day of the Rest of Their Lives".
